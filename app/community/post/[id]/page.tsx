  title: "How do you deal with exam anxiety?",
  content: `Finals are coming up and I'm feeling overwhelmed. My heart races every time I think about studying, and I can't seem to focus on anything. I've tried deep breathing exercises, but they only help temporarily.

I know I'm not the only one going through this, but it feels so isolating. Sometimes I wonder if I'm cut out for college at all. The pressure to perform well is constant, and I feel like I'm drowning.

Has anyone found strategies that actually work for managing this kind of anxiety? I'm open to trying anything at this point.`,
